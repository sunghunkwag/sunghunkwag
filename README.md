I explore recursive optimization and self-modifying learning systems
through small, hypothesis-driven experiments.

Repositories document iterative development cycles, testing
foundational assumptions about scalable learning architectures.
Most work is exploratory—probing failure modes, edge cases, 
and architectural tradeoffs in constrained domains.
