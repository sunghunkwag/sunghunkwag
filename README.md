Independent AI Researcher

I explore meta-learning, neural architectures, and autonomous agent systems
through small, hypothesis-driven experiments—with a subset focused on 
recursive self-improvement and self-modifying code synthesis.

Repositories document iterative development cycles, testing
foundational assumptions about scalable learning architectures.
Most work is exploratory—probing failure modes, edge cases, 
and architectural tradeoffs in constrained domains.
