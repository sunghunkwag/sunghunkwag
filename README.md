I explore meta-learning, neural architectures, and autonomous agent systems through small, hypothesis-driven experiments, including studies of autonomous optimization mechanisms and controlled self-modification processes.

Repositories document iterative development cycles and experimental evaluations of architectural assumptions under practical constraints. Most work is exploratory, with emphasis on failure modes, edge cases, and tradeoffs in constrained domains.
